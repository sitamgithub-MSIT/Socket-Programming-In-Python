# Socket Programming in Python 

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server. 
They are the real backbones behind web browsing. In simpler terms, there is a server and a client. 
Socket programming is started by importing the socket library and making a simple socket.
